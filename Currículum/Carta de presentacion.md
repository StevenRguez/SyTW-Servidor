To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities related to software engineering and frontend development. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of La Laguna, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the same institution, focusing on project management, web technologies, and big data analysis. This academic background, combined with hands-on experience, allows me to approach technical challenges with a well-rounded and solution-oriented mindset.

Recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at B-Water Studios, where I collaborated closely with various technical departments to maintain and build internal software tools used by animation, modeling, rigging, and lighting teams. During this time, I contributed to improving their production pipeline by developing tools that reduced repetitive tasks and enhanced cross-department efficiency. This role strengthened my ability to work in multidisciplinary environments and understand how software can streamline creative and technical workflows.

Beyond my professional experience, I have been actively involved in organizing the Technical Engineering Conferences, taking on responsibilities in coordination, design, communication, and company relations. These roles helped me develop strong organizational and leadership skills, as well as the ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.

On the technical side, I am experienced with Python, Java, and web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS, and I am familiar with software architecture, requirements analysis, and agile methodologies. I enjoy learning quickly, collaborating with motivated teams, and finding practical, thoughtful solutions to complex problems.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I could contribute to your team and ongoing projects. Please feel free to contact me for an interview or if you need any further information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Steven Rodríguez Morales.
